## 📋 Tasks Overview

Each task is implemented in its own folder with code, explanations, and instructions.

### 1. Number Guessing Game
- **What it does**: Generates a random number between 1 and 100; lets users guess and gives feedback (“too high/low”).
- **Features**: Multiple rounds, attempt tracking, and scoring system.

### 2. Student Grade Calculator
- **What it does**: Reads scores for various subjects, computes total and average, then assigns a grade (A–F).
- **Features**: Handles input validation and displays grade breakdown.

### 3. ATM Interface
- **What it does**: Simulates ATM operations — deposit, withdraw, and view balance.
- **Features**: Includes input validation and balance checks.

### 4. Currency Converter
- **What it does**: Converts between currencies using real-time exchange rates.
- **Features**: User-friendly interface and live rate integration.

### Tips for Final Touches
- Inside each task folder, include a mini README summarizing how to compile/run that specific project.
- Add screenshots or short GIFs of each application in action for better visualization.
- Link to any live demos, sample videos, or walkthroughs if available.
- Tag with appropriate GitHub Topics, e.g., `java`, `cli-app`, `learning`, etc.

Let me know if you'd like help with customizing any specific task or adding visuals!
